### Question

A friend once told me some in the Muslim community think people tend to die more (often) in the month of Shaban. As a data scientist, what do you think?

### Approach

Please make use of (but not limited to) the data by the [Medina Municipality](https://services.amana-md.gov.sa/eservicesite/Inq/DeathInquiry.aspx)

Structure your analysis with the following components:

1. Refine your objective
2. Collect the data (save the data in the directory `data/`)
3. Data Exploration and Data Cleaning
4. Modeling
5. Summarize your results
6. List any resource you used

You may code in `python` or `R` in a jupyter notebook environment.
