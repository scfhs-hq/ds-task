## Introduction
My name is Yasser Alnakhli. My professional experience includes Research Innovation and Development with deep knowledge in data science. I seek through my experiences to achieve vision 2030 goals. Crafting algorithms and making use of machine learning to mine and make sense of data, and then using data visualization to present said data to decision makers. Couple this experience with my passion for data I’d be an excellent fit for any data science potion. 

	
## Project1 R
I used R to Explore and Summarize Migrants data. Migrant Deaths by month “Missing Migrants Project draws on a range of sources to track deaths of migrants along migratory routes across the globe. Exploration and predictive analysis.

## Project2 Kaggle Challenges
In this project, Kaggle has been used to practice the modeling process. Regression and classification models have been built to be applied on the Ames housing.


## Project3 DATA WRANGLING
- Open Street Map Data Wrangling of Amsterdam City, The Netherlands, has been used.
- The data has been downloaded as XML format from (https://mapzen.com). Thu, Jun 15, 2017.


## Project4_ML_FraudDetection
This project is about using the machine learning skills to investigate Enron employees who may get involved in the fraud

## Project5 Web APIs & Classification
This prject about webscraping, APIs, Natural Language Processing, and some additional classification methods. The major 2 skills were used in this is 1. Collecting data by via an API and then 2. building a binary predictor on text data.
